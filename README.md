Use a data matrix as the source of all the statistical analyzes. It is the overview of the data. However, make use of summaries of the data if one wants to present the findings to other people. One very good way to summarize is by making frequency tables. If necessary the quantitative variables can be recoded into ordinal ones.
It is always a good idea to summarize the data by means of graphs. If one is dealing with nominal or ordinal variables, one should make a pie chart or a bar graph. If the variable of interest is an interval ratio variable, one should make a histogram. It is essential to not forget to look at the shape of the variable. Assessing the shape of a distribution is of essential importance, because it could affect the statistical methods that will be employed later on.

## Exploring Data

To describe the center of a distribution, three measures of central tendency, the mode, the median, and the mean can be used . If the variable is categorical, mode can be used, and if it's quantitative, the median or the mean can be employed. The median could be chosen if there are influential outliers or if the distribution is highly skewed, and if that's not the case, the mean can be chosen.
The center of a distribution only tells one part of the story. A box plot shows important aspects of a distribution using three quartiles, the outliers, and the range of the data after removing the outliers for a more complete picture also assess the variability of a distribution.
